Some notes about the test cases:

- issue1349 includes three incremental tests that each fail with a different
  error. They take a bit of time to minimize but not too much.

- issue1996 is fast.

- issue1998 takes a long time to minimize.

- issue2031 is fast.

- issue2029 gets stuck in the COMMANDS pass as well. It seems like the timeout
  does not work correctly. Note: This is a difficult test case because the
  error takes about 30s to trigger on the original input (it does get faster
  afterwards).

- ddSMT manages to minimize issue2033 significantly but gets stuck at some
  point in the substitute COMMANDS pass.
