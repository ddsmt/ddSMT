Contributing
============

We very much welcome any external contribution, for example to improve the
documentation to help other users or to add new mutators that allow for novel
simplifications.

The easiest way to submit your contribution is to fork `ddSMT on github
<https://github.com/ddsmt/ddSMT/>`_ and create a pull request from a branch that
contains your changes.
