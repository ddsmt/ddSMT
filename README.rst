ddSMT: Delta Debugging for SMT-LIBv2
====================================

**ddSMT** is a delta debugger for input in the `SMT-LIB
<http://www.smtlib.org>`_ language and its dialects and extensions.
It serves as an **input minimizer** for SMT-LIB(-like) input that triggers
interesting behavior for a given command.
Noteworthy examples for supported extensions of the SMT-LIB language are 
the `SyGuS <https://sygus.org/>`_ input format and the extension for
encoding `separation logic <https://sl-comp.github.io/docs/smtlib-sl.pdf>`_
problems.
For more details on the SMT-LIB language, see http://www.smtlib.org.
