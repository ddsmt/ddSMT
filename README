===============================================================================

  This is version 0.9-beta of ddSMT [0], a delta debugger for the SMT-LiB v2
  format (see [1] for more details on the format).

  ddSMT is free software released under the GPLv3. You should have received 
  a copy of the GNU General Public License along with ddSMT (see file 
  COPYING). If not, see [2].


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 General:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  ddSMT serves as an input minimizer for Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) benchmarks
  in SMT-LIB v2 format. It supports all SMT-LIB v2 logics and has been tested
  on the SMT-LIB v2 benchmark set.

  ddSMT is implemented in Python 3 and developed on a Linux OS. ddSMT requires
  Python version 3.2 or later. Note that due to major improvements with respect
  to the internal string representation in Python 3.3 (see [3]) it is strongly 
  recommended to use Python version 3.3 (or later).

 Changelog:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Since version 0.94-beta:
    + added consts caching
    + added substitution phase: eliminate redundant variable bindings
    + added substitution phase: bvand/bvor with true/false constant
    + parser: memory optimization (define __slots__)
    + fix: parser: tokenize: regex too greedy
  Since version 0.93-beta:
    + added sorts caching
    + added substitution phase: Boolean terms with fresh variables
    + fix: indexed functions handling
    + fix: parser: find_fun must consider sort for new nodes
  Since version 0.92-beta:
    + added support for and/or with true/false constant
    + added support for term substitution in define-fun
    + do not substitute terms per command, but for all commands at once
    + disable select substitution (incorrect, redundant)
    + fix: unique id for substvars
    + fix: parser: select/store array sort check
  Since version 0.91-beta:
    + arg parser: minor fix if cmd not given
    + parser: runtime optimizations
    + parser: minor fix in scope handling
    + parser: minor fix in get_pos() when ';' in symbol/string
    + added support for ':named' annotations
  Since version 0.9-beta:
    + parser: fix handling of ';' within symbols and strings

 Usage:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ddSMT minimizes a failure-inducing input in SMT-LIB v2 format based on the
  exit code of a given command when executed on that input. Note that any
  output produced during that execution is ignored.

  Note that ddSMT supports on-the-fly input minimization, i.e. as soon as an
  input minimization was successful it is available as the output file
  specified. Hence, it is not necessary to wait for ddSMT until completion,
  which can be useful for hard to minimize input files with long solver 
  execution times.

  Further note that ddSMT currently enables assertions and debug code by
  default (as it is still a beta release). Use -o to remove assertions and
  run ddSMT with python optimization flag -O enabled.

  Folder structure:
    ./ddsmt/
    ./ddsmt/ddsmt.py
    ./ddsmt/parser
    ./ddsmt/parser/__init__.py
    ./ddsmt/parser/smtparser.py
    ./ddsmt/parser/ddsmtparser.py

  Invocation:
    
    ./ddsmt.py [<options>] <infile> <outfile> <cmd> [<cmd options>]

  Positional arguments:
    infile:   the input file in SMT-LIB v2 format
    outfile:  the outputfile
    cmd:      the command to be executed (with optional arguments)

  Optional arguments:
    -h, --help    show a help message and exit
    -t val        timeout for test runs (command execution) in seconds
                  (default: none)
    -v            increase verbosity
    -o            remove assertions and debug code
    --version     show program's version number and exit
